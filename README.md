# Logic Circuitry

Learning about computer engineering in my University Class. I thought
it might be a fun project to try and simulate the logical gates in a
computer program. I'm going to skip CMOS transistors because their
behavior is a little confusing at the moment. But I'm excited to start 
working on this project!
